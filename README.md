# Hello-World
My first repository, for Ideas, thoughts, and just plain old bullshit

#just made my first branch.  this is for readme-edits.  the idea is, to make a 
change in the readme file, and then save it.  and then merge back into the master and, then the readme-edit branch
gets deleted?

Lets find out.
